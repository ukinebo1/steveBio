                <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
                <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written <br>
                as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every <br>
                email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I <br>
                interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a <br>
                PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. <br>
                And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be <br>missed,
                Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

                <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I <br>knew
                him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he has <br> taken too soon. I 
                can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly <br> gained an angel.</p>

                <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to describe <br>my feelings.
                For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple <br> produts, I have found a new lifestyle 
                thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've <br> been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is <br>
                connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a <br>genius</p>
